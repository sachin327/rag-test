Newton's law of motion is the physical law that states that the force acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object times its acceleration. The law is a fundamental principle of classical mechanics and is used to describe the motion of objects in the absence of external forces. It is one of the most important laws in physics and has been used to explain the motion of objects in a wide range of applications, including the motion of planets, stars, and galaxies.
